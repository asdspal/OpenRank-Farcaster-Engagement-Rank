    "## Why is Community Engagement Rank a good choice for Farcaster?\n",
    "\n",
    "Community Engagement Rank is an excellent choice for analyzing the Farcaster ecosystem for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Decentralized Social Network**: Farcaster is a decentralized social protocol, making engagement metrics crucial for understanding user interactions and influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. User Influence**: It helps identify the most influential and active users within the Farcaster community.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Content Quality**: By analyzing reactions and mentions, we can gauge the quality and impact of content shared on the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Network Growth**: It provides insights into how the Farcaster network is growing and evolving over time.\n",

    "## OpenRank: A Brief Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenRank is an open-source implementation of the EigenTrust algorithm, designed to compute trust scores in decentralized networks. It's particularly useful for analyzing and ranking entities in Web3 ecosystems, such as blockchain networks, decentralized social media platforms, and other peer-to-peer systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key features of OpenRank include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Decentralized Trust Computation**: It calculates trust scores without relying on a central authority, making it ideal for decentralized networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Customizable**: It allows for the incorporation of pre-existing trust information (pretrust) and can be adapted to various types of interaction data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Scalability**: OpenRank is designed to handle large-scale networks with millions of nodes and interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenRank is a powerful algorithm that operates on reputation graph data, which is constructed from peer-to-peer trust signals within a network. At its core, OpenRank interprets and analyzes complex webs of trust relationships, answering the fundamental question: \"Who trusts whom, by how much, and for what purpose?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Who (The Truster): Represents the entity extending trust. This could be a user, a node, or any participant in the network capable of expressing trust.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Whom (The Trustee): Denotes the recipient of trust. This is the entity being evaluated or trusted within the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. How Much: Quantifies the degree or intensity of trust from the truster to the trustee. This could be represented as a numerical value or weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. What (The Context): Specifies the nature or type of trust being extended. This crucial element provides context, defining the role or specific domain in which the trust is relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of our Community Engagement Rank for Farcaster, OpenRank will use the interaction data (reactions and mentions) to compute trust scores for users. These scores will reflect each user's influence and engagement level within the Farcaster community, based on how often they're interacted with and mentioned by others.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OpenRank algorithm takes two main inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Localtrust: This is derived from the direct interactions between users, which in our case comes from the SQL query results showing reactions and mentions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Pretrust: This is a set of nodes (users) that are considered trustworthy from the outset. For Farcaster, this could be based on verified users or other criteria. We will be using Power Badge users from warpcast platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying OpenRank to our Farcaster data, we can obtain a nuanced and sybil-resistant ranking of users based on their community engagement, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of the Farcaster ecosystem."
